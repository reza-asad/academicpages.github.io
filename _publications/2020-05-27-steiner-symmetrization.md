## Abstract
This note reports the results of an undergraduate research project from the year 2013-14, concerning the convergence of iterated Steiner symmetrizations in the plane. The directions of symmetrization are chosen according to the Van der Corput sequence, a classical example of a sequence that is equidistributed
in S<sup>1</sup> with low discrepancy. It is shown here that the resulting iteration of Steiner symmetrizations converges to the symmetric decreasing rearrangement. The proof exploits the self-similarity of the sequence of angular increments, using the technique of competing symmetries.
