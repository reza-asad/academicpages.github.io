- I am a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University working with Prof [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io). 
- My research intresets lie in applications of machine learning in computer vision and graphics. In particualr, I am very intereseted in understanding, generating and retrieving 3D scenes. In recent years, representing 3D scenes using graphs has coincided with great advances in Graph Representation Learning. In my current projects I also take this perspective to study 3D scenes. In addition to this, I am very intereseted in understnading, manipulating and generating 3D shapes using their implicit represetation.
- I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Pure Mathematics from Universit of Toronto. I was a research and teaching assistant at University of British Coloumbia for two years working in Applied Mathematics. After that I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and worked as a full time Data Scientist for 3 Years.

- [May 2020] My undergraduate adviser published the results from our USRA project from 2012 (funded by NSERC) on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13597). Our results seem to help other mathematicians.
