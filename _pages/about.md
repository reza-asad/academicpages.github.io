# About Me
- I am a PhD student at Simon Fraser University advised by [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io) and [Sharan Vaswani](https://vaswanis.github.io/). 
- Earlier in my PhD, I focused on 3D scene understanding. In particular, we built a self-supervised representation of 3D scenes that allows for better retrieval of similar 3D subscenes. There are two motivations behind [our work](https://reza-asad.github.io//publication/2023-06-18-3dssr): i) We can compress a large database of 3D scenes by deduplicating similar 3D subscenes or ii) We can edit the similar 3D subscenes to generate new 3D scenes and enrich the database. 
- I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Pure Mathematics from University of Toronto. I was a research and teaching assistant at University of British Coloumbia for two years working in Applied Mathematics. After that I moved to San Francisco Bay Area and worked as a full time Data Scientist for 3 Years.
