# About Me
- I am a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University working with Prof [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io). 
- My current research is focused on 3D scene understanding. In particualr, I am very intereseted in building self-superivsed representations of 3D scenes that allow for better retrieval of similar 3D subscenes. Once we are successful, we can edit or compress the similar subscenes in whatever way that is needed for a downstream application. Furthermore, we can render the results in a virtual or augmented reality setting. My work is inspired by current developements in self-supervised learning for images and my goal is to build models that work with 3D representations of scene data.
- I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Pure Mathematics from University of Toronto. I was a research and teaching assistant at University of British Coloumbia for two years working in Applied Mathematics. After that I moved to San Francisco Bay Area and worked as a full time Data Scientist for 3 Years.

News
======
- [May 2020] My undergraduate adviser published the results from our USRA project from 2012 (funded by NSERC) on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13597). Our results have been proved to be helpful for other mathematicians.
