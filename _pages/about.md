- I am a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University working with Prof [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io). 
- My research intresets lie in applications of machine learning in computer vision and computer graphics. In particualr, I am very intereseted in understanding, generating and retrieving 3D scenes. In recent years, representing 3D scenes using graphs has coincided with great advances in Graph Representation Learning. I use this perspective in my current projects to study 3D scenes. In addition, I am very intereseted in implicit neural representations for reconstructing, completing and generating 3D shapes.
- I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Pure Mathematics from Universit of Toronto. I was a research and teaching assistant at University of British Coloumbia for two years working in Applied Mathematics. After that I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and worked as a full time Data Scientist for 3 Years.
