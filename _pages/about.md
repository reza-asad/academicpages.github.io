## About Me
- I am a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University advised by [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io) and [Sharan Vaswani](https://vaswanis.github.io/). Prior to this, I worked as a full-time Data Scientist in the San Francisco Bay Area for 3 years. Before that, I was a research and teaching assistant at University of British Columbia for two years working in Applied Mathematics. I received my Bachelor's degree in Pure Mathematics from University of Toronto. 
## Research
- Earlier in my Ph.D., I focused on 3D scene understanding. In particular, we built a self-supervised representation of 3D scenes to better retrieve similar 3D subscenes. There are two motivations behind [our work](https://reza-asad.github.io//publication/2023-06-18-3dssr): i) We can compress a large database of 3D scenes by deduplicating similar 3D subscenes or ii) We can edit the similar 3D subscenes to generate new 3D scenes and enrich the database.
